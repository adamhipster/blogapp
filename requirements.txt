Goal: write a model-view-controller blog.

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
1. Do it in mongodb and in sequelize (shows that you decoupled the models).
2. Do it with 2 different views (shows that you decoupled the views). One in Bootstrap and the other in Material Design.

1. A blog backend with the ability to:
	a) Authenticate the user via sessions with a hashed password 
		* Note: user creation is via database only with a hashed password

		* With the ability to delete if admin
		* With the ability to edit if admin

2. A blog frontend with the ability to:

	b) Store sessions in Redis
	c) Perform extra security over HTTPS
	d) Deploy
	e) Use webpack
